// The local strategy require a `verify` function which receives the credentials
// (`username` and `password`) submitted by the user.  The function must verify
// that the password is correct and then invoke `cb` with a user object, which
// will be set at `req.user` in route handlers after authentication.

// Configure Passport authenticated session persistence.
//
// In order to restore authentication state across HTTP requests, Passport needs
// to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  The
// typical implementation of this is as simple as supplying the user ID when
// serializing, and querying the user record by ID from the database when
// deserializing.
